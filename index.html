        <p>
          I am from a small port town called cape may in New Jersey. My dad was
          a fisherman and since childhood I was fascinated by fishing and we
          often went camping. By the way, an interesting fact about me due to
          the fact that as a child I had an abundance of fish and seafood for 11
          years now, I have not eaten them at all. Also as a child I was a Boy
          Scout, I love nature and out door activities.

          I was always interested in cars and how they work, I wanted to be able
          to figure out why something didn't work. And that's why I went to
          mechanic school in Philadelphia and transferred there. There I met my
          wife, by the way she is from Belarus, a little country in Europe.
          Thanks to my acquaintance with her, I visited Belarus and other
          European countries a couple of times. There were hard times and I
          worked part-time in a restaurant where I was later promoted to a
          manager and at the same time I wondered where I could direct my
          passion in the desire to figure out how what works. Accidentally
          stumbled upon a book on an initial developer, I was drawn into it and
          I began to lack resources in free access to the poem, I decided to
          undergo training online while working as a manager.

          Among other things, I have a dog, and a little more about myself, I
          consider my strengths to be hard work and passion for the process, and
          I also like to understand the details. On a minus this is perhaps the
          fact that I really love karaoke, but I'm a bad dancer and can't sing.
